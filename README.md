Preliminaries
-------------

You need to use this LiquidCrystal Library.

https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal/downloads

I believe I used version LiquidCrystal_V1.2.1.zip

It's been tested with Newliquidcrystal_1.3.5.
  
  Installing.
  
  Place or symbolically link the 'libraries/washer' directory to 
  your sketchbook libraries folder. 
  Unzip the Newliquidcrystal directory and place its inner (main directory)
  in your sketchbook libraries folder.
  
  Start up your Ardunio IDE. Open wash_proj/wash_proj.ino.
